## Challenge: 

Recently, a cryptic artifact related to fr4nc1stein and laet4x was discreetly added, obscured by layers of syntax.

Your mission is to explore this intriguing mystery, uncovering hidden truths while navigating potential misdirection. Look for peculiar patterns and anomalies that might lead you closer to the secret.

Remember, the most valuable insights may be hidden amidst the chaos of code within its repositories. Good luck!

## Solution:

It is suppose to do something with code, since this is an OSINT challenge, we can guess codes can be upload to code repositories such as GitHub.

Searching `fr4nc1stein` in GitHub will show a user `https://github.com/fr4nc1stein/`. Checking the user's public repositories, there's a repository called `tcon` (https://github.com/fr4nc1stein/tcon)!

There's 5 commits in this repository. So looking for changes in the `readme.md` file.

The flag can be found in the commit [e240e49](https://github.com/fr4nc1stein/tcon/commit/e240e499a740e690953755769dbfd1263436a994#diff-5a831ea67cf5cf8703b0de46901ab25bd191f56b320053be9332d9a3b0d01d15R7) with the description "Old Poem".
